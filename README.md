# TwitBot
A Python bot that automates several actions on Twitter, such as following users and favoriting tweets.For this project I used Python's
Tweepy Library(https://www.tweepy.org/) and Twitter API

For running this project you will be needing a Twitter API key which can be obtained from https://developer.twitter.com/

To install Tweepy :-
1) If using Pycharm : File -> Settings -> Project -> Project Interpreter -> Click on '+' -> Select tweepy
2) From Terminal : pip install tweepy
